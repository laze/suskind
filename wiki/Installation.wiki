#summary Installation instructions for Süskind Framework.
#labels Phase-Implementation,Phase-Deploy,Featured
=== Introduction ===
The Süskind Framework is designed to be easy to install, and easy to use and work with it. Naturally, because it's a web server program, you need [http://www.apache.org/ Apache] server and [http://php.net PHP] to do anything with it. You can choose any of the handled database engines to use database for SF. (See: DatabaseResources)
Also if you install any other modules, then you have to check it's requirements, in that case, may be you should install other things.
=== Installation ===
First of all, get the source code from repository. SF stored in SVN, so, you'll need any SVN (Subversion) client to get it. We assume, that it's installed, and usable via terminal.
{{{
svn checkout http://suskind.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ suskind-read-only
}}}
After it's downloaded, you don't have to do anything with it.
=== Create an application ===
----
  This information is only for testing, later we would like to ad an application creator wizard.
----
To create an application, you just have to create two symlinks, therefore you just need a terminal.
{{{
 # Symlink Application to WWW
 ~$ ln -s /var/www/test ./suskind-read-only/Apps/Test/Public
 # Symlink Library to Süskind
 ~$ ln -s ./suskind-read-only/Apps/Test/Library ./suskind-read-only/Suskind
}}}
Please take attention with your symlink creations, they works only if the structure is the same as it's written. You can check your results, if you open a browser, and go to:
{{{
http://localhost/test/
}}}
