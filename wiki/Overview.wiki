Suskind - or Süskind - Framework, SF, created to develop web based applications as fast as possible. This is an MVC Framework, stores and relationships between models and their stores handled automatically. With this framework a developer is able to access remote APIs just like a file or a database on local server. The SF also handle plug-ins, so if any programmer need any custom functions, ha can do it. We design the SF to be extremely lightweight, and flexible and also easy-to-use.
