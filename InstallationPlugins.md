The installation is very easy, because the SF also use some foreign libraries. Actually you just have to copy your library into `Library` folder:
  1. First of all, create a folder for the library with name of it and let's begin the word with uppercase character, e.g.: `Library/Plugin`
  1. Let's copy the files under this folder. You should have a PHP class on top of your plugin with the same name, as `Library/Plugin/Plugin.php`, and also, you have these strict rules for the class name, so you should have a class named `Plugin`, in this file.
